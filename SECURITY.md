# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

1.x.x upon launch will be the only supported option. Should more versions arise, they will follow testing procedures to ensure their safety. We cannot guarantee the program is bug-free as with a lot of applications, but we do our best to prevent them from happening.

If a new major version is issued out, the previous may become deprecated after a period of time (at least 6 months) unless absolutely severe.
